# NetworkScanner
A compilation of program python code that can identify vulnerability and risk in the network. This code will scan the specified network for open ports. An open port is a potential vulnerability, as it may allow unauthorized access to the network. 
This code will scan the specified network for open ports. An open port is a potential vulnerability, as it may allow unauthorized access to the network.

Once you have identified open ports, you can further investigate the risks associated with each port by looking up the services that commonly run on those ports and determining their potential vulnerabilities.

It's important to note that a vulnerability scanner is just one tool that can be used to identify vulnerabilities and risks in a network. You should also implement other security measures, such as firewalls and secure password policies, to protect your network from threats.
