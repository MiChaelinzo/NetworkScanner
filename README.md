# NetworkScanner
A program python code that can identify vulnerability and risk in the network. This code will scan the specified network for open ports. An open port is a potential vulnerability, as it may allow unauthorized access to the network. 
This code will scan the specified network for open ports. An open port is a potential vulnerability, as it may allow unauthorized access to the network.

Once you have identified open ports, you can further investigate the risks associated with each port by looking up the services that commonly run on those ports and determining their potential vulnerabilities.

However, this is just a basic example and there are many other factors to consider when identifying vulnerabilities and risks in a network. You may want to consider using a more comprehensive security tool or consulting with a security expert to get a better understanding of how to identify and mitigate risks in your network.
